## Installation / Setup
**Please note: Whenever possible use DNN Dev Tools only in development, staging or QA-environments but not on production website.** Even though DNN Dev Tools only adds a minimal performance overhead, the purpose of the module is to help developers (and host admins) to analyze DNN environments and that should be done in a separate non-production environment.

DNN Dev Tools is installed just as any other DNN module:
 1. Download the most recent release DNN Dev Tools from here https://github.com/weweave/DnnDevTools/releases
 1. Log in as host admin and install the module on the page System > Extensions
 
**Please note:** After installing DNN Dev Tools, the module is (automatically) enabled and the DNN Dev Tools icon should be visible in the bottom right corner of every page. For security reasons DNN Dev Tools is only enabled for host admin users. To configure DNN Dev Tools settings, log in as host admin and browser to the page "System > DNN Dev Tools".

## Requirements

* DNN 08.00.00 RC (**Please note: Not compatible to DNN 08.00.00 beta or any DNN 08.00.00 CTP version)
* A-Grade browser (Firefox, Chrome, IE 11, Edge)
